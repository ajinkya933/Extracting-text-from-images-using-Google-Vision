# Google Vision API

Here I have extracted data from text and scanned documents using Google Vision API and Python. Please see attached screen shot for example

1) Install Google Cloud SDK
2) Generate a authentication key
3) Use this key to and run (python3 vision2.py)
4) Attached file.txt is the output of the Google Vision API
5) Output is shown in (Output_FolderName ). Here I have extracted Master Airway Bill Number, CONSIGNEE and Port of Destination from folder 80 and 2110 
6) The Same code (vision2.py) can be applied on other folders.
